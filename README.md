# Fantano Reviews Project

*In this project*, I will analyze and visualize data of albums rated by "The Internet's Busiest Music Nerd," Anthony Fantano. Fantano's YouTube channel "The Needle Drop" has 2.12 Million subscribers (as of April 2020) and he has rated over 1,700 albums. After analyzing and visualizing the data, I will make a Neural Network to predict future album ratings.

The Jupyter Notebooks should be read in this order:
1. fantano_eda (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. fantano_visualizations (Visualizations)
3. fantano_neural_net (Neural Network)
